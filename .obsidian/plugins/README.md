# Plugins
A collection of plugins, and their configs, that we think are useful.

## Calendar
Calendar primarily creates an interactive calendar view in the right sidebar.
This allows you to quickly move between each day's daily note.
It will also create daily notes for days that don't have them.
This can be useful for planning specific tasks for days ahead of time.

### Notable Config Changes
None at this time.

### Commander
Commander gives you the ability to create and modify custom commands and map them to controls within the Obsidian UI.
This is very useful for repeated tasks or commands that are basically navigation actions.

### Notable Config Changes
- Navigation button for opening quarterly note added to left ribbon
- Hid the quick switcher from the left ribbon
- Set icon spacing to 15

## Periodic Notes
Periodic notes follows the same course as Obsidian's built-in daily notes.
This plugin adds weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly notes.

### Notable Config Changes
- Set periodic notes directory to "periodic_notes"
- Disabled weekly notes
- Enabled monthy notes
- Set monthly note format to "YYYY/MMM"
- Set the monthly note template location to "templates/monthly note template.md"
- Enabled quarterly notes
- Set quarterly note format to "YYYY/[Q]Q"
- Set the quarterly note template location to "templates/quarterly note template.md"

## Recent Files
This plugin adds a list of files by most recently visited to the bottom left sidebar.

### Notable Config Changes
Due to this plugin storing a user's recent files in its config, the config for this plugin is not kept in this repository.

## Paste URL Into Selection
This is a small plugin that allows you to select a section of text, then press ctrl/cmd + V to create a new link.
This is very useful when you're injecting an external link into the natural text of a sentence.
